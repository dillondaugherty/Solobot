<h1>What is solobot? </h1>
<ul type="disc">
     Solobot is a 3d sidescrolling platformer with shooter elements. 
     The player controls the main character Bud Miller and attempts to break him 
     out of a mad scientist's robot factory. Fighting through hoards of the
     scientist's robotic guards, the player must collect powerups, steal abilities,
     and navigate dangerous obstacles in order to defeat powerful opponents. Combining 
     gameplay elements of the popular classics Megaman and Kirby, Solobot will provide 
     an engaging, enjoyable experience.
